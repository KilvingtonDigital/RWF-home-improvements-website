## Custom Deck Design & Build in Fayetteville

A custom deck is more than just added square footage—it’s an extension of your lifestyle. In North Carolina, where outdoor living is possible year-round, a well-built deck becomes the heart of family gatherings.

### Choosing the Right Material

* **Pressure-Treated Wood**: The most cost-effective option. We use high-grade southern yellow pine treated to resist rot and termites. It requires annual sealing or staining to maintain its appearance.
* **Composite Decking**: Brands like Trex offer a "forever deck" solution. Though a higher initial investment, composite boards simulate wood grain without the risk of splintering, warping, or fading. It’s ideal for bare feet and pets.

### Multi-Level & Custom Features

Our design team specializes in maximizing difficult terrains.

* **Sloped Yards**: We build multi-level decks that turn unusable slopes into tiered entertainment zones.
* **Built-Ins**: Integrated bench seating, planter boxes, and pergolas add functionality and style without cluttering the space with furniture.

### Safety & Code Compliance

Deck safety is paramount. We adhere strictly to North Carolina residential building codes regarding footing depth, load-bearing capacity, and railing height. Whether we're replacing an old, unsafe structure or building new, your family’s safety is our priority.
