## Maintenance Tips for Deck Longevity

A little care goes a long way in preserving the beauty and structure of your deck. Here’s how to keep it in excellent condition:

1. **Annual Cleaning**: Clean your deck with mild soap and water to remove dirt, mold, and mildew.
2. **Seal or Stain Wood Decks**: Wood decks benefit from sealing or staining every 2–3 years to protect against moisture and UV damage.
3. **Check for Loose Fasteners**: Regularly inspect your deck for loose nails, screws, or bolts and tighten them as needed.
4. **Cover in Winter**: If possible, cover your deck during the winter months to protect it from ice and snow buildup.
