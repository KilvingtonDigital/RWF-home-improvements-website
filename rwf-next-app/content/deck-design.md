Deck Materials for Every Style and Climate
------------------------------------------

###### Selecting the right material is essential to creating a deck that’s beautiful, durable, and suited to North Carolina’s unique weather. We offer a range of materials, each with its own aesthetic and functional advantages:

![Wooden Deck.jpg](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e6aca2_fa862a3a50004dfaa7f998f086c2a42f~mv2.jpg/v1/crop/x_164,y_138,w_1023,h_1034/fill/w_109,h_110,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/Wooden%20Deck.jpg)

###### Composite Decking:

For low maintenance and durability, composite decking is a top choice. Resistant to fading, splintering, and warping, composite is ideal for busy homeowners who want an attractive deck with minimal upkeep.

![Decking around Pools.jpg](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e6aca2_6f4a8243077e457784fecff14395230d~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_130,h_73,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/Decking%20around%20Pools.jpg)

###### Natural Wood:

Classic and versatile, wood brings warmth and character to any deck. Options like cedar and redwood offer natural resistance to rot and insects, with pressure-treated pine as a budget-friendly alternative.

![Deckk and Fencing.jpg](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e6aca2_95adce992f644710ba78374db979afe7~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_147,h_196,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/Deckk%20and%20Fencing.jpg)

###### PVC Decking:

PVC decking offers weather resistance, easy cleaning, and durability, making it a great choice for areas exposed to heavy rain or intense sunlight.

Design Inspiration for Every Lifestyle
--------------------------------------

###### No matter your lifestyle or design preferences, we can create a deck that reflects your personality and enhances your outdoor living space. Here are a few ideas to spark your imagination:

![Decking around Pools.jpg](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e6aca2_6f4a8243077e457784fecff14395230d~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_130,h_73,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/Decking%20around%20Pools.jpg)

### Entertainer’s Paradise:

Picture a spacious multi-level deck with a BBQ station, comfortable seating, and lighting, perfect for hosting friends and family.

![Wooden Deck.jpg](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e6aca2_fa862a3a50004dfaa7f998f086c2a42f~mv2.jpg/v1/crop/x_232,y_0,w_967,h_1002/fill/w_106,h_110,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/Wooden%20Deck.jpg)

### Nature’s Retreat:

Surround your deck with planters, built-in benches, and natural wood finishes for a serene escape right outside your back door.

![Composite Decking.jpg](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e6aca2_8b04e02533dc4093889c1d4d72564fff~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_147,h_110,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/Composite%20Decking.jpg)
