### Quality Wood

Our wood fencing materials include pressure-treated pine, cedar, and redwood, each chosen for their resilience against weathering and pests. Pressure-treated pine offers robust protection against decay and insects, while cedar and redwood naturally resist moisture and rot, enhancing the fence’s lifespan.

### Professional Craftsmanship

With our skilled installation team, each fence is crafted with precision. We dig deep-set posts and secure each board to prevent warping, ensuring your fence stays straight and secure even in harsh weather conditions. Plus, we offer staining and sealing options to protect and enhance the natural look of your wood fence.

#### Maintenance Tips for Longevity

To get the most out of your wood fence, regular maintenance is essential. Here are some tips for keeping your fence in top shape:

### 1\. Stain or Seal Regularly

Applying a stain or sealant every 2–3 years protects against UV rays, moisture, and insect damage.

### 2\. Inspect for Damage

Check for loose boards, cracks, or signs of rot annually to address minor issues before they worsen.

### 3\. Clean the Fence

Wash away dirt, mold, or mildew periodically with a mild detergent or pressure washer to preserve its natural beauty.
