## Custom Wood Fencing in Fayetteville

Whether you prefer the rustic charm of split rail or the classic beauty of board-on-board, wood fencing remains a timeless choice for North Carolina homes.

### High-Quality Lumber Selection

We understand that wood fencing is an investment. That's why we use pressure-treated pine and cedar, materials known for their resistance to our region's humidity and termite activity.

* **Pressure-Treated Pine**: Economical and durable, treated to resist rot and fungal decay.
* **Cedar**: Naturally resistant to insects and moisture, offering a rich, reddish hue that ages gracefully to minimal gray.

### Custom Designs & Gates

Every yard is different. We custom-build your fence on-site—adjusting for slopes and property lines—rather than using pre-made panels that leave unsightly gaps.

* **Shadow Box**: Provides privacy while allowing wind to pass through (crucial during storm season).
* **Picket**: Decorative styles like Dog Ear, Gothic, or French Gothic.
* **Privacy**: Tall, solid board designs effectively block noise from busy roads like Raeford Road or Cliffdale.

### Maintenance Recommendations

To extend the life of your wood fence in Fayetteville's sun, we recommend staining or sealing every 2-3 years. This protects against UV graying and minimizes warping from moisture absorption.
