## Your Guide to Fence Installation in Fayetteville, NC

Choosing the right fence for your Fayetteville home involves more than just picking a style—it’s about understanding our local climate, soil conditions, and regulations. At RWF Home Improvements, we don't just build fences; we build lasting property assets tailored to the Sandhills region.

### Why Material Matters in North Carolina

Fayetteville’s humid subtropical climate brings hot summers and significant rainfall. This makes material selection critical:

* **Vinyl** is increasingly popular here because it is impervious to moisture and rot, handling our humidity with zero maintenance.
* **Aluminum** offers the elegance of wrought iron but won't rust, making it ideal for pool codes and decorative boundaries.
* **Wood** (Pressure-Treated Pine or Cedar) remains the classic choice but requires staining to protect against UV rays and moisture absorption. We exclusively use high-grade lumber to maximize lifespan.

### Navigating Local Permits and HOA Rules

In Cumberland, Harnett, and Lee counties, fence regulations can vary.

* **Permits**: Generally, fences under a certain height (usually 6-7 feet) may not require a building permit, but zoning setbacks must be respected. Corner lots have specific visibility rules.
* **HOAs**: Many subdivisions in Fayetteville (like Jack Britt, Gates Four, or Anderson Creek) have strict covenants regarding material (often prohibiting chain link) and height. We can help submit your plot plan for HOA approval to ensure compliance before we dig the first hole.

### Our Installation Process

We treat your yard with respect. Our process includes:

1. **Utility Marking**: We always call 811 to have public utilities marked before digging.
2. **Precision Layout**: Using string lines and levels to ensure your fence is straight and follows property boundaries.
3. **Concrete Setting**: We set posts in concrete mixed to the correct consistency for our sandy loam soil, ensuring stability against high winds.

Whether you need a privacy sanctuary or a secure play area for pets, our local expertise ensures your fence stands strong for years.
