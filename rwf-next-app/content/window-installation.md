## Energy-Efficient Window Replacement in NC

Upgrading your windows is one of the smartest investments for Fayetteville homeowners. Not only does it boost curb appeal, but it significantly reduces heating and cooling costs in our fluctuating climate.

### Why Energy Efficiency Matters Here

Fayetteville experiences hot, humid summers and chilly winters. Old, single-pane windows are major sources of energy loss.

* **Low-E Glass**: Our windows feature Low-Emissivity coatings that reflect infrared light (heat) while letting visible light in. This keeps your home cool in July and warm in January.
* **Argon Gas Fill**: The space between double or triple panes is filled with inert argon gas, acting as a superior insulator compared to regular air.

### Styles for Every Home

* **Double-Hung**: The classic choice for traditional homes, allowing ventilation from both top and bottom sashes.
* **Casement**: Hinged at the side and cranking outward, these offer maximum visualization and airflow.
* **Picture Windows**: Fixed panes that frame your outdoor view like a piece of art, offering the highest energy efficiency due to being sealed.

### Professional Installation is Key

Even the best window will fail if installed poorly. Our certified installers ensure a weather-tight seal, preventing the drafts and moisture leaks that lead to structural rot and mold.
