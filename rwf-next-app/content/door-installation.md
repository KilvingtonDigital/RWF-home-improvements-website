## Secure & Stylish Entry Door Installation

Your front door is the first thing guests see and your first line of defense against intruders and weather. At RWF Home Improvements, we install doors that combine beauty with fortress-like security.

### Material Comparison

* **Fiberglass**: The gold standard for our climate. It mimics the look of wood grain but won't warp, rot, or dent. It is highly energy-efficient and secure.
* **Steel**: Offers the highest security rating. Modern steel doors come in attractive finishes and are incredibly durable against forced entry.
* **Wood**: Unmatched natural beauty for craftsman or historic homes. We install solid wood doors that, with proper maintenance, provide timeless elegance.

### Patio & Sliding Doors

Transition seamlessly to your backyard with our range of patio doors.

* **French Doors**: Elegant double doors that permit wide access, perfect for moving furniture or hosting parties.
* **Sliding Glass**: Space-saving designs with heavy-duty rollers for smooth operation and tempered glass for safety.

### Security Upgrades

All our door installations include heavy-duty strike plates and high-grade deadbolt preparation. We ensure the frame is anchored securely into your home's studs, not just the trim, providing real protection for your family.
