## Privacy Fencing Solutions for Seclusion

In a growing city like Fayetteville, privacy is a premium. Our privacy fencing solutions turn your backyard into a secluded retreat, blocking prying eyes and reducing neighborhood noise.

### Material Choices for Privacy

* **Vinyl Privacy**: The most popular option due to its solid panel construction (no gaps) and height (typically 6ft or 8ft). It effectively blocks visibility and dampens sound.
* **Wood Privacy**: Board-on-board or stockade styles offer complete privacy. Wood also absorbs sound better than thinner materials, making it great for reducing road noise.

### Height & HOA Regulations

Most residential areas in Fayetteville allow privacy fences up to 6 feet in the backyard. Corner lots may have visibility triangles to respect. If your HOA restricts height or material, we can work with you to find a compliant solution—often using lattice-top designs to add style while maintaining the required "openness" at the top.

### Security Benefits

A solid privacy fence is a strong deterrent. By removing the line of sight into your yard, you protect your valuable belongings (grills, furniture) and provide a safe, enclosed environment for children and pets to play without distraction.
